Practicing my API skills by making a very simple application that tells you the weather conditions and temperature in a city of your choice.

## Download

1. Navigate to the [Releases](https://github.com/basicallycommits/api-practice-weather/releases) page of the repository.
2. Download the latest `.zip` file from the list of available releases.

## Usage

1. Extract the contents of the downloaded `.zip` file.
2. Double-click the `.exe` file to run the application.
3. For weather data, this application uses the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/). You'll need an API key from OpenWeatherMap to access weather information. Simply paste it in the provided text box. You *do not* need to press enter.

> **Warning:** Your antivirus software might block the application. If this happens, you may need to whitelist the `.exe` file in your antivirus settings.
